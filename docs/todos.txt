Todos for UI:
    Create basic HTML, CSS, JS UI for user form input(later use vue JS)
    The form should generate a JSON string specified using DDL

Todos for Backend:
    API endpoints - On hold until tech stack decided.
    DDL:
        (First Priority) Logic to create columns according to existing attribute config mentioned in /docs/workflow_design.txt
        Decide on complex attributes like relation, variance etc.
        SQL type DDL to create cols according to configuration
    Concepts:
        RNG(Random Generators - Numbers, Strings etc)
        Generating data with relationship among columns

    For now, design logic for simple columns and ignore the configs like relation, variance etc.
