This project generates test data according to given column configuration. 


Currently following configurations for columns are supported:
    name: Column Name       
    type: Datatype             
    subType: More details of datatype                 
    maxLen: Max length of Characters    
    minLen: Min length of characters    
    rangeType: The format in which rnage will be specified
    range: Range of data        
    format: Format of floating point number (e.g. "S9V999")      
    variance: Variance in case of numeric or decimal

    template: Use a previously created template   
    custom: Custom DDL script    

It will be ensured that data geenrated will be roughly uniform

Data will be generated according to column configs and a url to download will be returned.

Until decided, just create scripts and UI
Tech Stack:
    UI: 
        (Vue JS or
        vanilla HTML, CSS, JS)
    API and Logic: 
        (Django or
        Fast API or
        django-ninja)
        with pandas, numpy

Concepts:
    RNG(Random Generators - Numbers, Strings etc)
    Generating data with relationship among columns
